      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a results-driven retail and operations professional with over eight years of experience working in international retail environments, specializing in merchandising operations, visual execution, inventory management, and cross-functional coordination. Throughout my career, I have consistently supported business performance by ensuring strong in-store execution, healthy stock flow, and alignment between commercial strategy and operational reality.</p>

<p> professional journey includes progressive roles within global retail brands, where I have worked closely with merchandising, planning, buying, logistics, visual, and store teams. I have contributed to seasonal assortment execution, monitored sales and inventory performance, supported demand forecasting, and implemented operational improvements such as FIFO stock rotation processes to reduce aged inventory and prevent losses. I am known for my attention to detail, analytical mindset, and ability to translate data into actionable insights that support decision-making.</p>

<p>In addition to my retail expertise, I bring a solid technical foundation supported by a background in computer science and hands-on experience in IT support. This technical exposure has strengthened my problem-solving approach, allowing me to analyze challenges logically, improve processes, and support operational efficiency across both digital and physical environments.</p>

<p>I have led and trained teams, maintained high execution standards, and adapted quickly to fast-paced, high-pressure environments. Whether working on the sales floor, behind operational processes, or alongside corporate teams, I focus on consistency, accuracy, and continuous improvement. I take pride in being dependable, adaptable, and committed to delivering work that directly supports business objectives and customer experience....</p>
